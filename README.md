# Emailer
Emailer is an advanced & premium-quality email sending plugin. It allows you to either connect to the default gmail smtp service or your own, and send real emails to players. Your can either send emails using HTML, or, if you're not familiar with it you can use plain text.

## Prerequisites
- Java 8 or above.
- A spigot server running >= Spigot 1.8
- An emailing service (Gmail will do)

## Installation
While you are free to compile the plugin from here and use it on your server, it would be highly appreciated if you could support me and my work by buying it on Spigot (https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/66184/). After adding the jar on your server, you should configure the config.yml and rest configuration files to your liking. You are ready to go!. You can then find a more documented guide here https://github.com/LagBug/Emailer/wiki/Installation

## In action
These are a few images demostrating the plugin in action. You can also test it yourself by joining my minecraft server at `lagbug.me`
